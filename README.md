**NDWI-using-GEE**

**Remote sensing** is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft).
Special cameras collect remotely sensed images, which help researchers "sense" things about the Earth. Some examples are:

    1. Cameras on satellites and airplanes take images of large areas on the Earth's surface, allowing us to see much more than we can see when standing on the ground.
    2. Sonar systems on ships can be used to create images of the ocean floor without needing to travel to the bottom of the ocean.
    3. Cameras on satellites can be used to make images of temperature changes in the oceans.

Some specific uses of remotely sensed images of the Earth include:

    1. Large forest fires can be mapped from space, allowing rangers to see a much larger area than from the ground.
    2. Tracking clouds to help predict the weather or watching erupting volcanoes, and help watching for dust storms.
    3. Tracking the growth of a city and changes in farmland or forests over several years or decades.
    4. Discovery and mapping of the rugged topography of the ocean floor (e.g., huge mountain ranges, deep canyons, and the “magnetic striping” on the ocean floor).



The  **Normalized  Difference  Water  Index**  (NDWI)  (Gao,  1996)  is  a  satellite-derived  index  from  the 
Near-Infrared (NIR) and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) channels. The SWIR reflectance reflects changes 
in  both  the  vegetation  water  content  and  the  spongy  mesophyll  structure  in  vegetation  canopies, 
while the NIR reflectance is affected by leaf internal structure and leaf dry matter content but not by 
water  content.


**Applications:**
During  drought  event,  vegetation  canopy  can  be  affected  by  water  stress.  This  can  have  major 
impact on the plant development in general and can cause crop failure or lower crop production in 
agricultural areas. Early recognition of plant water stress can be critical to prevent such 
consequences. By providing near-real time information on the plant water stress to the 
stakeholders,  water  and  agricultural  management  can  be  much  improved,  notably  by  irrigating 
specifically areas where plant water needs are not fulfilled anymore. 



With the imagery collected from the most recent **Landsat-8** dataset, one of NASA's latest missions involves the Landsat 8, an orbiting satellite whose purpose it is to map the earth with 
reflectance data and track changes as seen from space along with filtering algorithms to produce the required reflectance band data, we can analyze the regions of high water content
of a specific territory along with a choice of time period to perform time series analysis of the same to study variations in different weather conditions.
